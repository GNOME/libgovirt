0.3.0 - October 29, 2013
========================

Changes since 0.2.0:

- Add support for listing storage domains and the files they contain
- Add support for changing the CDRom available in a VM
- Introduced an OvirtApi class which represents the toplevel oVirt
  collection from which one can access VMs, storage domains, ...
  This means that various OvirtProxy methods to fetch VMs have been deprecated
  in favour of using OvirtApi + OvirtCollection methods
- Rework certificate handling, OvirtProxy now has a 'ssl-ca-file' property
  that can be used to specify which CA certificate should be used to validate
  remote certificates.
- Certificate checking is now enforced by default unless
  OvirtProxy::ssl-strict is set to FALSE
- ABI/API hasn't been broken, even though some functions were deprecated

0.2.0 - July 5, 2013
====================

Changes since 0.1.0:

- Break ABI :(
- Switch back to using GSimpleAsyncResult (from GTask) to gain
  compatibility with older glib versions
- Refactor internals to make it much easier to add support for more
  REST collections
- Parse more VM states from the OvirtVm resource

0.1.0 - June 7, 2013
====================

  to connect to a VM which is using SPICE

  properties
- Implement ovirt_vm_refresh_async()
