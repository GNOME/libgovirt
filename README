GoVirt is a GObject wrapper for the oVirt REST API [1]. It will
only provide very basic functionality as the goal is to
autogenerate a full wrapper as it is already done for the python
bindings

Note: GoVirt is not API or ABI stable at this time, so don't complain
when we break your compile. That said, we're not going to break API
without a good readon. Caveat emptor.
