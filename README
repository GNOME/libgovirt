GoVirt is a GObject wrapper for the oVirt REST API [1]. It will
only provide very basic functionality as the goal is to
autogenerate a full wrapper as it is already done for the python
bindings.

NB: at this time, govirt is *NOT* considered API/ABI stable. Future
releases may still include API/ABI incompatible changes.
